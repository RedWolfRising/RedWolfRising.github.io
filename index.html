         <p>I am an American gamer. I play mostly Minecraft, but I also play Age of Kings, Overwatch, and a mobile game or two. 
             My channel is based on Minecraft, and will stay that way.</p>

             Here is my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3OGmsDPsTAc8Rd6N1JgI7w">YouTube Channel</a>, I haven't posted much recently,
             but I hope to post more soon. I want to learn how to edit and create quality content, so that I can take it and use it in this
             and in my life and ministry.
         </p> 
         <p>
            I am currently a dual credit student enrolled at Bob Jones University.
